    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>OSSCE was founded in 2025 by Louisa Hai√ü. The aim? To <strong>make research accessible</strong>. That means making our research available to our peers, our government and the general public, but also making the skills needed to share our research accessible. We have found that, especially for STEM disciplines, there is very little education on how best to communicate our research, and it's difficult to get into science communication as a field. However, it's a vital skill for all scientists and researchers in general, especially with the rise of fake news, AI and widespread misinformation.. The answer? OSSCE - a place where researchers at all career stages can pick up these vital skills while networking with their peers.</p>
