Splatoon is a game I am super passionate about and have been for a long, long time. Here's a very piecemeal review with a bunch of random infodumping about the better squid game right here on your doorstep! It was originally in the shrines segment of The Old Site (we do not speak of Her) but has been brought forward because, well, I like it. Enjoy!

### What is Splatoon?

Splatoon is a series of third person platforming shooters by Nintendo for the Wii U (Splatoon) and Nintendo Switch (Splatoon 2 and 3). In each game, the player takes control of an inkling (or, in later games, an octoling) - an evolved squid (or octopus) who is able to change between humanoid and squid forms. The humanoid form can fire weapons which shoot ink, and the squid form can submerge in ink to hide, replenish ammo or climb walls. While each game has a single player campaign mode, the majority of gameplay is from 4v4 online matches in a few different game modes with different objectives. Players can choose from a variety of ink weapons and use gear to enhance their abilities (and style). Beyond innovative gameplay, Splatoon is famous for its unique sense of style and deep environmental storytelling, putting youth culture and fish puns in a blender to produce a vibrant world with beloved characters and surprisingly in-depth lore.

### Why do you like Splatoon?

I started playing Splatoon when it first released for the Wii U in 2015 at the age of 12. It was my first ever shooter game and I found it surprisingly easy to pick up, given that everyone else was having the same learning curve with Splatoon's new style of gameplay (the ink mechanics) and control (gyro controls) as I was. Because of this, I never felt outmatched and quickly fell in love with it! Splatoon's gameplay feels snappy and precise. The skill ceiling is high but more importantly it's fun to play and fun to get good at. Even after so many years of constant play I still haven't mastered every weapon so there's always something to do! Online gameplay feels comfortable because of the simplified communication system compared to voice chat. Frequent events keep the game interesting, and with Splatoon 2 came Salmon Run for cooperative gaming. I think what's kept me with the series after all this time is a combination of the sheer fun value and the incredible style.

As you can probably tell by my site, I'm a big fan of that cheesy graffiti-covered vaguely 90s skater style and Splatoon is just full of it! But it goes deeper than a surface-level aesthetic. The games put a surprising amount of effort into the culture and worldbuilding of the squid kids. Every game features new idols to tell you about events, new shopkeepers to sell you gear and weapons, and new single player characters - both friends and enemies. These characters each have their own in-depth backstory and return throughout the games, building a cohesive world which, due to the level of interaction the player has with these characters, feels completely alive. Furthermore, the player's own character is a vital part in the overarching story of Splatoon. In the first game, you play as a 14 year old squid who, in the single player campaign, helps the Squid Sisters defeat DJ Octavio and becomes Agent 3 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon. In the DLC to Splatoon 2 (Octo Expansion), Agent 3 features both as an ally and as a boss fight, with customisation options so the player can make their Agent 3 from their time playing Splatoon 1. In Splatoon 3, Agent 3 has become Captain 3 and is now a central leadership figure in the story, helping your new player character on their way. The characters age, they develop, they change - heck, the Squid Sisters have got a podcast now! The world feels so real and it's very easy to get attached to these characters, especially when you grow up with them the way I did.

### What are your strategies and tips?

I tend to play mid- and long-range weapons as you can see by my favourites, so tip #1 would have to be knowing your weapon's range and how it compares to others. This dictates how you're going to approach a fight - staying away if you can outrange them or using the terrain to approach if you don't. I would also suggest not neglecting gear. If your weapon can one-shot, get ninja squid so you can sneak up on people. If you take a few hits to kill, thermal ink may be more useful so you can keep track of targets. It's helpful to have an idea of the layout of every map so you can head straight for useful vantage points and also know where to keep track of enemies who may try flanking (but not on splat3 maps since thats impossible lololol).

The number one tip is to remember that there's a reason turf war is the first mode available to you in Splatoon. You should always be working to cover turf and maintain the turf advantage around objectives. That way it's harder for enemies to move in and you can see them more easily when they do. It also keeps you more mobile and increases the rate you'll get specials at, which are absolutely vital for reclaiming objectives or pushing forwards.
