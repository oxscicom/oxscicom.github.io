# Committee and board

OSSCE is run by an elected committee of students, and overseen by a Senior Advisory Board.

## Committee

| **President - Luisa Hai√ü**<br><br>Luisa is the founder and first President of OSSCE. She is studying for a DPhil in Molecular Cell Biology in Health and Disease. Her background in politics gives her a unique insight into the way that research is transformed into policy. In her own words, she sees science communication as a form of "reciprocal learning" - by explaining your work to others, you can come to understand it better yourself. As President, Luisa is responsible for coordinating the committee and ensuring the society meets long-term goals. | ![image](/assets/images/committee-pics/luisa.png)    |
